# E-commerce Event-Driven Product Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a simple e-commerce product management system that allows users to dynamically interact with product details based on their selections. It is designed to enhance user experience by updating the product price and stock availability in real-time. Users can choose a product size, and the price is automatically updated. If the selected size is out of stock, the purchase button is disabled.

Additionally, the system allows users to add new products dynamically to the product list. The project demonstrates event handling, dynamic updates, and event delegation using JavaScript.

## Features

1. Dynamic Price Updates: The price of the product is updated automatically when a user selects a size from the dropdown.
2. Stock Availability: The system displays stock availability for each size. If out of stock, the purchase button is disabled.
3. Purchase Confirmation: Upon clicking the purchase button, a message confirms the purchase if the item is in stock or indicates it is out of stock.
4. Add New Products: Users can add new products to the list via a form. Newly added products are fully interactive due to event delegation.
